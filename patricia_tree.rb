# This is an implementation of of a Patricia (radix) tree:
#  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree
#
# This was created for use with MagLev, but perfectly fine to use in any other
# Ruby implementation.
#
# This type of tree is useful for performing prefix searches
# (e.g. "give me all strings starting with 'Bob'")
# since the tree is organized starting from the first sequence
# in a given key (the key might be a string, which is a sequence
# of characters) and "narrows down" as you descend the tree. 
#
# Because of the prefix-searching property, this data structure
# can be useful for indexing object fields in MagLev, giving
# you the same power you'd usually have with an RDBMS using a B-Tree 
# index on a text field, enabling efficient "LIKE 'ABCTEST%'" 
# prefix searches.  Note that MagLev can speed up such queries
# in a similar manner with indexes, but as of 2010-june-29, 
# sorted returns are not supported and there is a performance
# benefit in using this data structure over an equality index
# when there is a large data set that you only want the top N
# ordered results from.
# 
# The tree serves as a dictionary/map and is reasonably good 
# at conserving space, provided there is a fairly large number 
# of words/sequences that share common prefixes.
# 
# = To do =
# * like Hash, should we use a default value instead of nil ? this alters the way store() and other methods would work, so need to decide early
# * Adding in support later for deletion/insertion/fetching on the root node itself (an empty key) sort of invalidated some of the 4-case code; might need to be cleaned later
# * Put up a clearer license header
